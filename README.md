# Water Quality Prediction 

The project aims to predict the quality of water based on selected chemical metrics using machine learning techniques â€” specifically, a `MultiOutputRegressor` wrapped around an `XGBoostRegressor`. Multiple models were compared, and XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and generalization. The predicted pollutant concentrations can later be used to classify water quality into categories based on established threshold values.

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4
- BOD5 (BSK5)
- Suspended Solids (Colloids)
- O2 (Dissolved Oxygen)
- NO3 (Nitrate)
- NO2 (Nitrite)
- SO4 (Sulfate)
- PO4 (Phosphate)
- CL (Chloride)
