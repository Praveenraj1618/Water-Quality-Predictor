# Water Quality Prediction 

The Project aims to Predict Quality of Water based on few metrics using machine learning techniques  specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor.Then classify the water into categories by quality level.

## Predicted Water Quality Parameters

The model predicts multiple water quality parameters such as:

- NH4
- BOD5 (BSK5)
- Colloids
- O2, NO3, NO2, SO4, PO4 and 
- CL
